# Planet Garden

Hello! Welcome to our CISC275 final project!

Planet Garden is a website made entirely with React Typescript where you can shop for landscaping products and maintain the various products available and users of the website. There are 3 possible roles you may select (Owner, Shopkeeper, and Customer), and each one has different permissions and available features, guaranteeing a different experience overall.

### Our Goal
As **Planet Gardeners** our goal is to create beautiful and sustainable landscapes that exceed your expectations! Our catch phrase says it all: We Bring the View to You!

As **software engineers**, our goal with this project is to learn about React and handling state, become more comfortable with Git and GitHub, and experience working in an Agile team.

### See Our Website
You can run the website locally by opening your terminal and entering
```npm run start```.

Or you can directly see the deployed website here on GitHub by going to ```Environments``` in the right column of this repository's main page, and then clicking ```View deployment``` at the top of the page.
